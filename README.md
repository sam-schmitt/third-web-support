# Thirdweb Support Demo

## Getting Started

1. First get your server ready by installing all dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Then adjust your config.ts file to include your ThirdWeb clientId

3. Then start your development server

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. Now connect to a wallet

6. Then issue a prompt for simple transactions across multiple chains

   - Swap 1 USDC for DAI (both on arbitrum) and 1 USDC for DAI (both on optimism)

7. Wait for the data to fully load. You should see a large object/array of data presented on screen when it is finished.

8. Then click the confirm button on the bottom of the page.

9. Then observe the web console to see the errors thrown and the failure of the ThirdWeb client to switch chains
